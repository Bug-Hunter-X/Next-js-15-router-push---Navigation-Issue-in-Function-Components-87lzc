# Next.js 15 - `router.push()` Navigation Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle navigation issue that can occur in Next.js 15 when using `router.push()` within function components.  The issue is particularly noticeable when navigating from a component that is quickly unmounted or before changes are properly reflected in the UI.

## The Problem

The `router.push()` method, while generally reliable, can fail to execute correctly if the component where it's used is unmounted before the navigation process completes.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the navigation not happening or an error not being immediately apparent.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the `/about` page.
5. Click the "Go back to Home" button.

Under normal circumstances the transition should work. However, under certain conditions, the transition might fail silently.

## Solution

The provided solution in `about-solution.js` addresses this by handling potential lifecycle issues related to component unmounting.  While the exact nature of the race condition might vary based on the application, carefully managing the use of the router within component lifecycles can alleviate this problem.
